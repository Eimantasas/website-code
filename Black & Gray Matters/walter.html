        Walter Hartwell “Walt” White Sr., also known by <br>
        his pseudonym and business moniker Heisenberg is an <br> 
        American former chemist and major narcotics distributor <br>
        from Albuquerque, New Mexico, whose drug empire became <br>
        the largest meth operation in American history, surpassing <br>
        both Gustavo Fring’s drug empire and the Cartel’s. Before <br>
        entering the drug trade, Walt was a respected chemist and <br>
        scientist who later worked as an overqualified high school <br>
        chemistry teacher at J. P. Wynne High School alongside working <br>
        at the A1A Car Wash to financially support his family. However, <br>
        later Walt started manufacturing chemically pure crystal <br>
        methamphetamine to provide for his family.

        Walt went into hiding in New Hampshire and remained <br>
        in hiding for almost a year. Eventually, Walt returned <br>
        to Albuquerque for unknown reasons and was now found dead <br>
        in a methamphetamine laboratory with multiple others dead in <br>
        another building. The cause of these deaths seems to be a <br>
        machine gun contraption built in to a trunk of a car.

        It was able to completely pierce through the walls of the <br> 
        building and brutally murder everyone in it. The casualties <br>
        are devastating, but there seems to be evidence that at least <br>
        2 people survived and got away. Unfortunately, Walter Hartwell <br>
        White was not one of those people.
